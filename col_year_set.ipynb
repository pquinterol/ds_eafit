From rural communities in South America to villages in Africa, Earth's students and graduates are improving labor conditions, starting their own businesses, generating employment, defending biodiversity and promoting sustainable development practices. Academic programs - the university curriculum includes four distinct educational activities that focus on experiential learning: student entrepreneurial projects, work experience, internships, and professional experience. Academic support programs - In addition to its core curriculum, the university stresses active participation through planned activities, laboratory and field work as well as independent research projects. The university carries out innovative research that is directed at improving agriculTural production practices to address the challenges that currently confront rural communities in the tropics. EARTHs campus has an academic farm which is used by the students as a laboratory to do work in their fields. The commercial farm is used to develop agricultural activities and generate money to support the academic program. The campus provides sports facilities such as soccer fields, baseball fields and tennis courts. There is also a gym that can be used for basketball, volleyball and indoor soccer. The gym includes a weight room and a pool. In addition, the students have access to different services such as Internet, mail, fax couriers, cafeteria, laundry room, medical services, psychological and nutritional services, and personal physical training. In 2018, the School had a banner year, with the following highlights: 1. 428 students hailing from 38 countries 2. 49% female student population 3. 96% of students matriculating on full or partial scholarship 4. 85% of students graduate in four or five years The amount reflected as grants in Program Service 4a represent student stipends and amounts paid to local rural communities. Scholarship expenses are not recorded in the functional expenses of the Form 990.","15345576","392140","15047748","Agri-business banana plantation - the university operates a banana plantation that assists its students to learn the values and ethics of biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. The operation of the plantation supports the institution economically and academically. The university, in conjunction with the Kellogg foundation, developed renewable products (such as paper) from the waste - a model that has proven instrumental in environmental conservation in latin america. The University's agri-business endeavors extend beyond the plantation, as the students get involved in the sale of crop seeds, livestock, and other agricultural commodities. These activites teach the students to be conscientious and dutiful stewards of the earth and its finite resources.","-","10755427","0","10966764","-","1292368","671538","Special Projects - In addition to its educational and agricultural activities, the University also undertakes special environmental projects at the behest of governmental entities and other organizations. Examples of such projects include: 1. The Aga Khan Network approached EARTH to become a partner in a project to reform the Bilibiza Technical Secondary School in Northern Mozambique and incorporate aspects of the EARTH educational model. Since then, retired EARTH professor, Panfilo Tabora has been contracted by the Aga Khan Network to promote entrepreneurship and agro-business in Mozambique. 2. The German Ministry of Environment financed a collaboration between EARTH University and the Renewables Academy in Berlin to promote renewable energy, including: the equipping of a laboratory, visiting professors and renewable energy training in Germany. 3. The Community Development Program (PDC) is a learning platform that promotes the exchange of knowledge between students and communities, contributing to the development of skills and attitudes in students to become agents of change capable of participating and developing projects that improve the quality of life in rural communities of Costa Rica. In addition, hundreds of families of small-scale producers have participated in training processes and workshops exchanging knowledge in order to increase their income, improve their nutrition, family health and more. The three central objectives of the PDC are: A. Contribute to the formation of social awareness of students: The PDC promotes the academic development of the students through strategies of connection with different communities. B. To help improve the quality of life of the neighboring communities of the cantons of Gucimo, Siquirres and Pococ: The students, teachers and managers of the PDC participate in a wide range of activities to promote capacity building and share knowledge with farmers, families, youth and children in the communities. Different topics are worked on such as sustainable agriculture, natural resource management, rural entrepreneurship, food security and environmental awareness. C. Integrate the community experience in the academic program of EARTH University: The PDC serves as a platform for the academy to develop participatory research, knowledge exchange and extension projects based on the needs and priorities identified by the communities. The core areas of the Community Development Program are: Sustainable Agricultural Development: we work on the promotion of good agricultural and livestock practices, design of integrated farms, renewable energies, adequate waste management and environmental education. Community Social Projects: working in collaboration with schools, projects are developed for organizational strengthening, community food security and community history. Entrepreneurship and added value: the development of a business mentality and processes of transformation of raw material is promoted. In addition, knowledge is shared on issues such as the development of agricultural business plans, administrative-accounting processes, commercialization and marketing of rural microenterprises. IN 2017, EARTH STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IMPACTED MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES OF LA LUCHA, IRLANDA, SANTA ROSA AND RIO JIMENEZ, WITH DOZENS OF TRAININGS IN AGRICULTURAL BEST PRACTICES, FOOD PROCESSING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FORM 990, Part III - Other program service activities (4(D)) The University's continuing education program (PEP) facilitates the exchange of information between EARTH and the institutions or individuals involved in sustainable development in the humid tropics. The goal is to Establish permanent links with farmers in the region and their families to nourish the actions of research and teaching, in a way that students and professors learn about the causes of the problems that face the community and together with the community search for solutions. STRATEGICALLY, THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM (PEP) IS A KEY COMPONENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPED BY EARTH WITH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES (SCIENTIFIC, ACADEMIC, INSTITUTIONAL, NGO'S, PRIVATE SECTOR, ETC.). MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTER ALSO GENERATE INCOME WHICH IS USED TO SUSTAIN THIS CENTER. PEP HAS CULTIVATED A STABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES ALLOWING IT TO DEVELOP: - Educational activities - Research projects - Educational

NorthBridge provides students with a multi layered support system that focuses on both academic success and personal development. The program includes individualized academic advisement, weekly academic support sessions, individual mentoring sessions, student success workshops, and coordinated social events. NorthBridge served 800 students through the 2018 19 program year. NorthBridge has now supported over 705 students in coaching and college retention. NorthBridge entered into a partnership with PhoenixUnion High School District and Valley of the Sun United Way, which resulted in a substantial increase in Accuplacer Ready enrollment. Through this partnership, NorthBridge was able to provide Accuplacer workshops to over 550 Phoenix Union High School students.

ALL SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS SHARE A DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO PERFORM BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AS EVIDENCED BY PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE. THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON EXTENDING THE ABILITY OF PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS THROUGH HANDS-ON LABORATORY EXPERIENCE THAT STRESSES HIGHLY CRITICAL THINKING IN COMBINATION WITH IN-DEPTH EXPERIENCE IN THE LATEST METHODOLOGIES. PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS PERFORM THESIS RESEARCH IN LABORATORIES WORKING AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MODERN BIOLOGICAL INQUIRY. IN AN AVERAGE TIME OF FIVE YEARS FROM MATRICULATION, PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL QUESTION, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A PH.D. IN BIOLOGY. THE PROGRAM OF GSSIMR STRESSES CRITICAL THINKING AND THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL PROWESS, INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL DIDACTIC COURSEWORK. IN AUGUST, THE PREDOCTORAL RESEARCH PROGRAM STARTS WITH A SERIES OF SEVEN INTENSIVE ALL-DAY MODULAR SEMINARS WITH TOPICS INCLUDING TRANSCRIPTION AND CHROMATIN, DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY, GENOMICS AND NEUROSCIENCE. THE MODULES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LAB WORK, AS WELL AS LECTURES AND CRITICAL READING AND DISCUSSION OF RELEVANT PAPERS. A CONCURRENT FIFTEEN-WEEK SEMINAR SERIES IS DEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NECESSARY PROFICIENCY IN CRITICAL THINKING, READING, AND WRITING. IN SPRING OF THEIR FIRST YEAR, PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ENGAGE IN THREE CONSECUTIVE TWO-MONTH ROTATIONS IN LABS OF THEIR CHOICE. UNDISTRACTED BY TRADITIONAL COURSEWORK, EXPECTATIONS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH FOR PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS TO FOCUS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON A SHORT-TERM RESEARCH PROJECT. PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ENTER THEIR THESIS LABS IN JUNE OF THEIR FIRST YEAR AND UNDERGO AN ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE, PERFORMANCE, AND RESEARCH PROGRESS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM CULMINATES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT EACH PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY INTERESTING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, DEVISE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO THOSE PROBLEMS, AND EXECUTE INVESTIGATIONS USING THE BEST TOOLS AVAILABLE. THE COMPLETION OF A BODY OF RESEARCH THAT ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN AT LEAST ONE PUBLICATION IN A HIGH-IMPACT JOURNAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PH.D. RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE PUBLICATION FORMS THE MAIN BODY OF A THESIS. A DETAILED LITERATURE REVIEW PRECEDES THE THESIS AND A DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS IN THE RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE THESIS. PRESENTATION OF AN OPEN SEMINAR ALSO IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE RESEARCH PROGRAM. AFTER A PERIOD OF ORGANIZATION, PREPARATION AND RECRUITMENT, THE FIRST CLASS OF GSSIMR BEGAN THE PH.D. PROGRAM IN AUGUST 2012. AT THE END OF 2019, THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF EIGHT CLASSES, MADE UP OF 43 PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS WITH VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BACKGROUNDS FROM 14 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.","1285700","-","547413","GSSIMR HAS ANOTHER INSTRUCTION PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM. THE MISSION OF THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE AN INVALUABLE LABORATORY EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE SERIOUS SCIENCE SCHOLARS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL AND A FUTURE IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH. EACH SCHOLAR PARTICIPATING IN THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM WORKS ON AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT. THE PROGRAM OFFERS SCHOLARS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME IMMERSED IN A RESEARCH TOPIC FOR A FULL-TIME EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD. STOWERS SCHOLARS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR LABORATORY AND THE STOWERS COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. IN THIS WAY, STOWERS SCHOLARS EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY THE INTELLECTUAL BUT ALSO THE COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT OF RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, STOWERS SCHOLARS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE LATEST TECHNIQUES IN LABORATORIES AND SUPPORTING CORE CENTERS, WHICH ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. STOWERS SCHOLARS SPEND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME IN THE LABORATORY. ALL SCHOLARS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND WEEKLY SCIENTIFIC SEMINARS ON AN ARRAY OF RESEARCH TOPICS.

Institute is the premier independent institution of higher education committed to ensuring that all children have equitable opportunities to reach their potential. Recognized for our groundbreaking work in the field of early childhood, we uniquely prepare child development, education, and social work leaders to improve the lives of young children and their families. Our impact and influence is further amplified through our innovative academic programs, applied research, knowledge creation and distribution, direct service, and field-wide advocacy. Because nothing matters more than a child's early years, Erikson Institute educates, inspires, and provides leadership to serve the needs of children and families so that all can achieve optimal education, social, emotional, and physical well-being.","false","false","-","ACADEMICS: Through contemporary master's degree, doctoral degree, and graduate certificate programs, Erikson Institute prepares leaders in child development, social work, and early childhood education. We offer the most comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding of children and families through classes on campus and online. In 2019, Erikson had the largest incoming class in its history with 168 new students; more than 400 students are enrolled across all our graduate education programs. We also offer programs to help professionals who work with children and families hone their skills, learn new techniques, and earn credits to maintain their professional licenses.","6321285","2152139","10170592","DIRECT SERVICES: Erikson provides services directly to children and families, as well as consulting and training for the professionals who serve them. Erikson's Center for Children and Families provided intensive mental health services for 660 children and families in the Chicagoland area in 2019, the highest number in the Center's 11-year history. In addition to its main clinic located at Erikson's River North campus, CCF has established three satellite clinics in high-need Chicago neighborhoods. CCF also oversees a broad range, immigration-related trauma initiative, the only one of its kind in the state. In partnership with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Erikson conducts assessments of the state's most at-risk children and families referred to the child welfare system, assures referrals for Early Intervention and mental health services, and trains child welfare professionals across the state. Erikson's Fussy Baby Network served over 1,000 families in Cook County in 2019, providing home visits, group sessions and phone support for parents and caregivers with concerns about their infant's crying, sleeping or eating patterns.","-","2633768","178005","7451472","-","3470087","0","\"RESEARCH, POLICY & LEADERSHIP: Erikson conducts research that bridges theory and practice, generating new knowledge that invigorates our academic courses, services, and programs, and improves life for children and families in Chicago and throughout the nation. Research areas include early childhood math, social emotional learning, literacy, home based childcare, home visiting programs, and technology and media for children and families. Using evidenced-based research, Erikson's Early Childhood Leadership Academy provides early childhood and civic leaders with content knowledge to make the most informed decisions about policy setting and resource allocation.

CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMONG THE NATION'S TOP COLLEGES, UNION IS A LEADER IN EDUCATING STUDENTS TO BE ENGAGED, INNOVATIVE AND ETHICAL CONTRIBUTORS TO A DIVERSE, GLOBAL AND TECHNOLOGICALLY COMPLEX SOCIETY. FACULTY, STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS WELCOME DIVERSE AND TALENTED STUDENTS TO THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY, WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO PROVIDE A BROAD AND DEEP EDUCATION, AND GUIDE THEM IN FINDING AND CULTIVATING THEIR PASSIONS. THE COLLEGE OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES AND INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS IN THE LIBERAL ARTS AND ENGINEERING, AS WELL AS ACADEMIC, ATHLETIC, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY ABROAD AND TO PARTICIPATE IN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY SERVICE.","false","false","-","THE UNION COLLEGE CURRICULUM EMPHASIZES COLLABORATION WITH STUDENTS AND FACULTY THROUGH SMALL CLASSES AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH, INTERNATIONAL STUDY AND LEARNING THROUGH SERVICE. THROUGH ITS UNIQUE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO THE LIBERAL ARTS, UNION COMBINES THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, EMPHASIZING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF IDEAS THROUGH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE. WITH MORE THAN 40 MAJORS AND 55 MINORS TO CHOOSE FROM, UNION STUDENTS CAN PURSUE DOUBLE MAJORS; COMBINE MAJORS AND MINORS; SELECT INTERDEPARTMENTAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATIONS, AND AREA, ETHNIC AND CULTURAL STUDIES PROGRAMS; OR DESIGN THEIR OWN MAJOR. MOST STUDENTS TAKE THREE COURSES IN EACH OF THE THREE 10-WEEK TERMS THAT COMPRISE UNION'S ACADEMIC CALENDAR SYSTEM. NEARLY EVERY ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT REQUIRES STUDENTS TO COMPLETE SOME FORM OF RESEARCH IN THEIR SUBJECT AREA, AND STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ONE-ON-ONE WITH THEIR PROFESSORS. AT STEINMETZ SYMPOSIUM EACH SPRING, SOME 400 STUDENTS PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THEIR RESEARCH, SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES. MANY STUDENTS CO-AUTHOR PUBLICATIONS WITH THEIR PROFESSORS AND PRESENT AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH (NCUR). MANY PARTICIPATE IN BUSINESSES, HEALTH CARE, GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICE INTERNSHIPS. THE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS A HALLMARK OF A UNION EDUCATION, WITH NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF STUDENTS PURSUING STUDIES, RESEARCH, INTERNSHIPS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS ABROAD. ON CAMPUS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEADERSHIP, DISCUSSION AND COMMUNITY ABOUND IN THE MINERVA SYSTEM, OFFERING RESIDENTIAL, ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS. EVERY INCOMING STUDENT IS ASSIGNED TO ONE OF SEVEN MINERVA HOUSES, WHICH ALSO INVOLVE FACULTY AND STAFF. UNION'S BECKER CAREER CENTER HELPS STUDENTS WITH CAREER PLANNING, INTERNSHIPS AND THE GRADUATE SCHOOL AND JOB SEARCH. RECENT TRENDS SHOW THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF GRADUATING SENIORS GO DIRECTLY TO GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS, AND UNION HAS EARNED AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION FOR PLACING GRADUATES IN MEDICAL, LAW AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. UNION'S MORE THAN 22,000 ALUMNI INCLUDE LEADERS IN ALL FIELDS, INCLUDING ARTS, MEDICINE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT, LAW AND POLITICS. GRADUATES INCLUDE NOBEL PRIZE AND ACADEMY AWARD WINNERS, A NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER AND A MCARTHUR FELLOW, AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SEVEN CABINET SECRETARIES, A SECRETARY OF STATE, 13 GOVERNORS, 200 JUDGES, 90 COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND THE 21ST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.","146903666","50614405","165308776","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","165308776","true","true","true","true","false","false","true","true","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","-","true","true","true","true","true","false","false","false","false","false","true","true","true","false","true","false","true","false","false","false","true","true","true","false","false","true","true","false","false","false","true","false","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","false","-","false","false","326","0","true","2691","true","true","true","false","false","false","-","false","-","true","true","false","-","false","false","-","-","-","-","-","X","39","34","true","false","false","false","false","false","false","true","true","false","false","-","false","true","true","true","true","true","true","true","false","-","-","X","-","-","12308","-","-","NY","-","-","-","807 UNION STREET","-","-","MICHELE M GIBSON","5183886104","schenectady","-","-","-","-","3772466","0","915225","129","true","true","false","24","-","3095994","2191816","904178","-","-","904178","1845624","-","-","1845624","3693328","209889545","146903666","32933","46494011","-","-","118424","-","2515289","13825222","3883976","16458935","-","-","-","-","147360724","7191586","-","-","7191586","0","-","-","-","0","-","-","-","124277","-","-","-","124277","0","124277","-","-","124277","204258926","-","170081256","-","34177670","-","34177670","-","-","34177670","33873","118424","55026","-21153","-","-21153","0","0","0","-","-","-","-","4028666","3507585","288262","232819","1452934","1452934","-","-","415221","4810","410411","-","224422","-","224422","-","692","-","-","692","-","0","-","3115730","125730","2990000","-","2562216","1874952","324493","362771","431308","260044","100972","70292","8536186","7560157","488111","487918","3674651","3416441","169581","88629","0","-","-","-","6064382","5310323","630707","123352","2857785","2507184","171110","179491","0","-","-","-","2705726","2200374","178518","326834","53010","53010","4541083","4534746","6337","-","0","-","-","-","10096346","10096346","-","-","1176566","180771","995795","-","-","-","-","-","183764804","165308776","12373749","6082279","-","-","-","-","-","50517545","50517545","43850","43850","0","-","3007841","1151120","1543872","312849","1106332","1106332","-","-","54965179","49637054","2526991","2801134","4673502","4087408","277969","308125","10920603","9559532","585080","775991","-","X","-","518932820","263921953","229662255","255010867","106456633","148600139","367410852","335979228","0","0","0","0","40302566","23131798","845680588","858695559","22361630","19659301","0","0","2076727","2087492","55610","18843","94540277","93009330","0","0","0","0","76112579","75092892","0","0","17091705","16734351","212182918","206583366","231527795","244344308","228979955","227872773","172989920","179895112","42251499","43288820","-","-","-","-","-","-","633497670","652112193","845680588","858695559","46758183","39020546","4589356","5386920","0","0","0","0","6118701","6165845","963256","1023517","1111677","1069036","X","26124741","-6709838","-","-","-","-800380","-","X","-","-","false","-","-","-","true","X","-","-","true","true","true",2020],[202021049349300412,237223216,"-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","NY","-","107085999","-","-","Bronxville","-","-","1 Mead Way","cristle collins judd",214390267,"false","-","-","-","-","-","X","www.sarahlawrence.edu","-","-","X","-","-","1926","NY","-","SARAH LAWRENCE COLLEGE IS A FOUR-YEAR LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE OFFERING SELECT GRADUATE PROGRAMS ON ITS MAIN CAMPUS IN BRONXVILLE, NY AND 4 UNDERGRADUATE OVERSEAS PROGRAMS.","5200616","1365605","452969","507726","113074818","118163792","36057993","33474544","0","0","50636547","51924047","0","0","4509487","33014782","30789715","120996822","114900806","-1825988","-2833030","-","234454086","243103825",89801098,"82316876","152137210","153302727","24","22",1789,"375","199402","0","11960502","9520182",104384716,"97846294","X","AT SARAH LAWRENCE COLLEGE, OUR MISSION IS TO GRADUATE CITIZENS OF THE WORLD WHO ARE DIVERSE IN EVERY DEFINITION OF THE WORD, WHO TAKE INTELLECTUAL AND CREATIVE RISKS, AND WHO ARE ABLE TO FOCUS EXCEPTIONAL INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE (CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O)","false","false","-","UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS: THE FREEDOM TO STEER YOUR OWN EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BASIS OF SARAH LAWRENCE'S ACADEMIC APPROACH.

From rural communities in South America to villages in Africa, Earth's students and graduates are improving labor conditions, starting their own businesses, generating employment, defending biodiversity and promoting sustainable development practices. Academic programs - the university curriculum includes four distinct educational activities that focus on experiential learning: student entrepreneurial projects, work experience, internships, and professional experience. Academic support programs - In addition to its core curriculum, the university stresses active participation through planned activities, laboratory and field work as well as independent research projects. The university carries out innovative research that is directed at improving agriculTural production practices to address the challenges that currently confront rural communities in the tropics. EARTHs campus has an academic farm which is used by the students as a laboratory to do work in their fields. The commercial farm is used to develop agricultural activities and generate money to support the academic program. The campus provides sports facilities such as soccer fields, baseball fields and tennis courts. There is also a gym that can be used for basketball, volleyball and indoor soccer. The gym includes a weight room and a pool. In addition, the students have access to different services such as Internet, mail, fax couriers, cafeteria, laundry room, medical services, psychological and nutritional services, and personal physical training. In 2018, the School had a banner year, with the following highlights: 1. 428 students hailing from 38 countries 2. 49% female student population 3. 96% of students matriculating on full or partial scholarship 4. 85% of students graduate in four or five years The amount reflected as grants in Program Service 4a represent student stipends and amounts paid to local rural communities. Scholarship expenses are not recorded in the functional expenses of the Form 990.</td><td>15345576</td><td>392140</td><td>15047748</td><td>Agri-business banana plantation - the university operates a banana plantation that assists its students to learn the values and ethics of biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. The operation of the plantation supports the institution economically and academically. The university, in conjunction with the Kellogg foundation, developed renewable products (such as paper) from the waste - a model that has proven instrumental in environmental conservation in latin america. The University's agri-business endeavors extend beyond the plantation, as the students get involved in the sale of crop seeds, livestock, and other agricultural commodities. These activites teach the students to be conscientious and dutiful stewards of the earth and its finite resources.</td><td>-</td><td>10755427</td><td>0</td><td>10966764</td><td>-</td><td>1292368</td><td>671538</td><td>Special Projects - In addition to its educational and agricultural activities, the University also undertakes special environmental projects at the behest of governmental entities and other organizations. Examples of such projects include: 1. The Aga Khan Network approached EARTH to become a partner in a project to reform the Bilibiza Technical Secondary School in Northern Mozambique and incorporate aspects of the EARTH educational model. Since then, retired EARTH professor, Panfilo Tabora has been contracted by the Aga Khan Network to promote entrepreneurship and agro-business in Mozambique. 2. The German Ministry of Environment financed a collaboration between EARTH University and the Renewables Academy in Berlin to promote renewable energy, including: the equipping of a laboratory, visiting professors and renewable energy training in Germany. 3. The Community Development Program (PDC) is a learning platform that promotes the exchange of knowledge between students and communities, contributing to the development of skills and attitudes in students to become agents of change capable of participating and developing projects that improve the quality of life in rural communities of Costa Rica. In addition, hundreds of families of small-scale producers have participated in training processes and workshops exchanging knowledge in order to increase their income, improve their nutrition, family health and more. The three central objectives of the PDC are: A. Contribute to the formation of social awareness of students: The PDC promotes the academic development of the students through strategies of connection with different communities. B. To help improve the quality of life of the neighboring communities of the cantons of Gucimo, Siquirres and Pococ: The students, teachers and managers of the PDC participate in a wide range of activities to promote capacity building and share knowledge with farmers, families, youth and children in the communities. Different topics are worked on such as sustainable agriculture, natural resource management, rural entrepreneurship, food security and environmental awareness. C. Integrate the community experience in the academic program of EARTH University: The PDC serves as a platform for the academy to develop participatory research, knowledge exchange and extension projects based on the needs and priorities identified by the communities. The core areas of the Community Development Program are: Sustainable Agricultural Development: we work on the promotion of good agricultural and livestock practices, design of integrated farms, renewable energies, adequate waste management and environmental education. Community Social Projects: working in collaboration with schools, projects are developed for organizational strengthening, community food security and community history. Entrepreneurship and added value: the development of a business mentality and processes of transformation of raw material is promoted. In addition, knowledge is shared on issues such as the development of agricultural business plans, administrative-accounting processes, commercialization and marketing of rural microenterprises. IN 2017, EARTH STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IMPACTED MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES OF LA LUCHA, IRLANDA, SANTA ROSA AND RIO JIMENEZ, WITH DOZENS OF TRAININGS IN AGRICULTURAL BEST PRACTICES, FOOD PROCESSING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FORM 990, Part III - Other program service activities (4(D)) The University's continuing education program (PEP) facilitates the exchange of information between EARTH and the institutions or individuals involved in sustainable development in the humid tropics. The goal is to Establish permanent links with farmers in the region and their families to nourish the actions of research and teaching, in a way that students and professors learn about the causes of the problems that face the community and together with the community search for solutions. STRATEGICALLY, THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM (PEP) IS A KEY COMPONENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPED BY EARTH WITH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES (SCIENTIFIC, ACADEMIC, INSTITUTIONAL, NGO'S, PRIVATE SECTOR, ETC.). MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTER ALSO GENERATE INCOME WHICH IS USED TO SUSTAIN THIS CENTER.

NorthBridge is becoming the premier college success program for students with learning differences as well as being the Valley's expert on transitioning to postsecondary education.</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>NorthBridge was founded on the principle that college aged young adults with learning differences can excel in post secondary education with specialized and individualized support. NorthBridge provides students with a multi layered support system that focuses on both academic success and personal development. The program includes individualized academic advisement, weekly academic support sessions, individual mentoring sessions, student success workshops, and coordinated social events. NorthBridge served 800 students through the 2018 19 program year. NorthBridge has now supported over 705 students in coaching and college retention. NorthBridge entered into a partnership with PhoenixUnion High School District and Valley of the Sun United Way, which resulted in a substantial increase in Accuplacer Ready enrollment. Through this partnership, NorthBridge was able to provide Accuplacer workshops to over 550 Phoenix Union High School students. The TechForceScholarship Ambassador Program showed dramatic results with improving retention among the 96 MMI UTI Ambassador students. Ambassadors had a 99% retention rate, compared to an average 59% retention rate of non program students.</td><td>232094</td><td>-</td><td>198669</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>198669</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>27</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>85022</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>AZ</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>14040

ALL SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS SHARE A DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO PERFORM BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AS EVIDENCED BY PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE. THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON EXTENDING THE ABILITY OF PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS THROUGH HANDS-ON LABORATORY EXPERIENCE THAT STRESSES HIGHLY CRITICAL THINKING IN COMBINATION WITH IN-DEPTH EXPERIENCE IN THE LATEST METHODOLOGIES. PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS PERFORM THESIS RESEARCH IN LABORATORIES WORKING AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MODERN BIOLOGICAL INQUIRY. IN AN AVERAGE TIME OF FIVE YEARS FROM MATRICULATION, PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL QUESTION, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A PH.D. IN BIOLOGY. THE PROGRAM OF GSSIMR STRESSES CRITICAL THINKING AND THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL PROWESS, INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL DIDACTIC COURSEWORK. IN AUGUST, THE PREDOCTORAL RESEARCH PROGRAM STARTS WITH A SERIES OF SEVEN INTENSIVE ALL-DAY MODULAR SEMINARS WITH TOPICS INCLUDING TRANSCRIPTION AND CHROMATIN, DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY, GENOMICS AND NEUROSCIENCE. THE MODULES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LAB WORK, AS WELL AS LECTURES AND CRITICAL READING AND DISCUSSION OF RELEVANT PAPERS. A CONCURRENT FIFTEEN-WEEK SEMINAR SERIES IS DEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NECESSARY PROFICIENCY IN CRITICAL THINKING, READING, AND WRITING. IN SPRING OF THEIR FIRST YEAR, PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ENGAGE IN THREE CONSECUTIVE TWO-MONTH ROTATIONS IN LABS OF THEIR CHOICE. UNDISTRACTED BY TRADITIONAL COURSEWORK, EXPECTATIONS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH FOR PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS TO FOCUS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON A SHORT-TERM RESEARCH PROJECT. PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS ENTER THEIR THESIS LABS IN JUNE OF THEIR FIRST YEAR AND UNDERGO AN ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE, PERFORMANCE, AND RESEARCH PROGRESS WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM CULMINATES WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT EACH PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY INTERESTING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, DEVISE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO THOSE PROBLEMS, AND EXECUTE INVESTIGATIONS USING THE BEST TOOLS AVAILABLE. THE COMPLETION OF A BODY OF RESEARCH THAT ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN AT LEAST ONE PUBLICATION IN A HIGH-IMPACT JOURNAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PH.D. RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE PUBLICATION FORMS THE MAIN BODY OF A THESIS. A DETAILED LITERATURE REVIEW PRECEDES THE THESIS AND A DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS IN THE RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE THESIS. PRESENTATION OF AN OPEN SEMINAR ALSO IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE RESEARCH PROGRAM. AFTER A PERIOD OF ORGANIZATION, PREPARATION AND RECRUITMENT, THE FIRST CLASS OF GSSIMR BEGAN THE PH.D. PROGRAM IN AUGUST 2012. AT THE END OF 2019, THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF EIGHT CLASSES, MADE UP OF 43 PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS WITH VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BACKGROUNDS FROM 14 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.</td><td>1285700</td><td>-</td><td>547413</td><td>GSSIMR HAS ANOTHER INSTRUCTION PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM. THE MISSION OF THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE AN INVALUABLE LABORATORY EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE SERIOUS SCIENCE SCHOLARS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL AND A FUTURE IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH. EACH SCHOLAR PARTICIPATING IN THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM WORKS ON AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT. THE PROGRAM OFFERS SCHOLARS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME IMMERSED IN A RESEARCH TOPIC FOR A FULL-TIME EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD. STOWERS SCHOLARS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR LABORATORY AND THE STOWERS COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. IN THIS WAY, STOWERS SCHOLARS EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY THE INTELLECTUAL BUT ALSO THE COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT OF RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, STOWERS SCHOLARS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE LATEST TECHNIQUES IN LABORATORIES AND SUPPORTING CORE CENTERS, WHICH ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. STOWERS SCHOLARS SPEND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME IN THE LABORATORY. ALL SCHOLARS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND WEEKLY SCIENTIFIC SEMINARS ON AN ARRAY OF RESEARCH TOPICS. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE A WEEKLY LUNCH WHERE SCHOLARS HEAR PRESENTATIONS BY STOWERS SCIENTISTS, SHARE IDEAS, AND DISCUSS INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND EXPERIMENTS. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, SCHOLARS PRESENT THEIR WORK IN AN ALL-INSTITUTE POSTER SESSION. IN 2019, THE STOWERS SUMMER SCHOLARS PROGRAM HAD 30 PARTICIPANTS FROM EIGHT COUNTRIES, REPRESENTED 30 SCHOOLS, AND PERFORMED RESEARCH IN 16 DIFFERENT LABS AT THE STOWERS

Erikson's Center for Children and Families provided intensive mental health services for 660 children and families in the Chicagoland area in 2019, the highest number in the Center's 11-year history. In addition to its main clinic located at Erikson's River North campus, CCF has established three satellite clinics in high-need Chicago neighborhoods. CCF also oversees a broad range, immigration-related trauma initiative, the only one of its kind in the state. In partnership with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Erikson conducts assessments of the state's most at-risk children and families referred to the child welfare system, assures referrals for Early Intervention and mental health services, and trains child welfare professionals across the state. Erikson's Fussy Baby Network served over 1,000 families in Cook County in 2019, providing home visits, group sessions and phone support for parents and caregivers with concerns about their infant's crying, sleeping or eating patterns.</td><td>-</td><td>2633768</td><td>178005</td><td>7451472</td><td>-</td><td>3470087</td><td>0</td><td>\"RESEARCH, POLICY & LEADERSHIP: Erikson conducts research that bridges theory and practice, generating new knowledge that invigorates our academic courses, services, and programs, and improves life for children and families in Chicago and throughout the nation. Research areas include early childhood math, social emotional learning, literacy, home based childcare, home visiting programs, and technology and media for children and families. Using evidenced-based research, Erikson's Early Childhood Leadership Academy provides early childhood and civic leaders with content knowledge to make the most informed decisions about policy setting and resource allocation. Participants have included some of the state's leading policymakers and community stakeholders, with over 100 alumni since its founding in 2016. Erikson's Community Data Initiatives help translate data for community planning, policy development, and early childhood resource allocation. In 2019, Erikson produced the Illinois Risk and Reach Report, which analyzes and translates data indicators in the areas of family stability, health and early care and education that affect the wellbeing of young children and how Illinois is allocating resources to mitigate \"\"risk\"\" factors undermining child

CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMONG THE NATION'S TOP COLLEGES, UNION IS A LEADER IN EDUCATING STUDENTS TO BE ENGAGED, INNOVATIVE AND ETHICAL CONTRIBUTORS TO A DIVERSE, GLOBAL AND TECHNOLOGICALLY COMPLEX SOCIETY. FACULTY, STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS WELCOME DIVERSE AND TALENTED STUDENTS TO THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY, WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO PROVIDE A BROAD AND DEEP EDUCATION, AND GUIDE THEM IN FINDING AND CULTIVATING THEIR PASSIONS. THE COLLEGE OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES AND INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS IN THE LIBERAL ARTS AND ENGINEERING, AS WELL AS ACADEMIC, ATHLETIC, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY ABROAD AND TO PARTICIPATE IN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY SERVICE.</td><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>-</td><td>THE UNION COLLEGE CURRICULUM EMPHASIZES COLLABORATION WITH STUDENTS AND FACULTY THROUGH SMALL CLASSES AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH, INTERNATIONAL STUDY AND LEARNING THROUGH SERVICE. THROUGH ITS UNIQUE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO THE LIBERAL ARTS, UNION COMBINES THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, EMPHASIZING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF IDEAS THROUGH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE. WITH MORE THAN 40 MAJORS AND 55 MINORS TO CHOOSE FROM, UNION STUDENTS CAN PURSUE DOUBLE MAJORS; COMBINE MAJORS AND MINORS; SELECT INTERDEPARTMENTAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATIONS, AND AREA, ETHNIC AND CULTURAL STUDIES PROGRAMS; OR DESIGN THEIR OWN MAJOR. MOST STUDENTS TAKE THREE COURSES IN EACH OF THE THREE 10-WEEK TERMS THAT COMPRISE UNION'S ACADEMIC CALENDAR SYSTEM. NEARLY EVERY ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT REQUIRES STUDENTS TO COMPLETE SOME FORM OF RESEARCH IN THEIR SUBJECT AREA, AND STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ONE-ON-ONE WITH THEIR PROFESSORS. AT STEINMETZ SYMPOSIUM EACH SPRING, SOME 400 STUDENTS PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THEIR RESEARCH, SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES. MANY STUDENTS CO-AUTHOR PUBLICATIONS WITH THEIR PROFESSORS AND PRESENT AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH (NCUR). MANY PARTICIPATE IN BUSINESSES, HEALTH CARE, GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICE INTERNSHIPS. THE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS A HALLMARK OF A UNION EDUCATION, WITH NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF STUDENTS PURSUING STUDIES, RESEARCH, INTERNSHIPS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS ABROAD. ON CAMPUS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEADERSHIP, DISCUSSION AND COMMUNITY ABOUND IN THE MINERVA SYSTEM, OFFERING RESIDENTIAL, ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS. EVERY INCOMING STUDENT IS ASSIGNED TO ONE OF SEVEN MINERVA HOUSES, WHICH ALSO INVOLVE FACULTY AND STAFF. UNION'S BECKER CAREER CENTER HELPS STUDENTS WITH CAREER PLANNING, INTERNSHIPS AND THE GRADUATE SCHOOL AND JOB SEARCH. RECENT TRENDS SHOW THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF GRADUATING SENIORS GO DIRECTLY TO GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS, AND UNION HAS EARNED AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION FOR PLACING GRADUATES IN MEDICAL, LAW AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS. UNION'S MORE THAN 22,000 ALUMNI INCLUDE LEADERS IN ALL FIELDS, INCLUDING ARTS, MEDICINE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT, LAW AND POLITICS. GRADUATES INCLUDE NOBEL PRIZE AND ACADEMY AWARD WINNERS, A NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER AND A MCARTHUR FELLOW, AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SEVEN CABINET SECRETARIES, A SECRETARY OF STATE, 13 GOVERNORS,
